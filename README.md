## What is Peeker?

**Peeker** is a **web component** that provides a preview window of your content.

Using **Peeker** as a web component, you:

- can add a previewer to your site out of the box

- don't pollute the thing not related to preview

- don't have to think about the framework stuff

All you have to do is:

1. prepare previewing data

2. import this script, and add the web component in your site

Check more in [ðŸ‘‰ how to use peeker](#how-to-use-peeker).

**Peeker** is very useful in some static content site, for example your blog, because it just makes the preview part instead of entire site dynamic (*web component is a "island" automatically*), which is good for SEO.

## How to use Peeker?

First, add this importing code to the head section of html:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@rileycki3333/peeker@1.1.0/dist/peeker.min.js"
></script>
```

Then, prepare a preview data json, with the schema:

> **Caution**: "rawData" will be **unsafely** rendered to HTML, you should check them before using. _It is suggested to use a generator rather than writing the json file manually._

```json
{
  "title": "a test",
  "linkTo": "/test.json",
  "rawData": "<article><p>this is just a test</p></article>"
}
```

Finally, add

```html
<vvv-peeker></vvv-peeker>
```

to the body of html, and put

```html
<vvv-peekable data-url="$$PATH_OF_THE_JSON$$">Click me</vvv-peekable>
```

to the anywhere you want in the body, it will be rendered to `<a>` tag.
